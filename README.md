<strong>Movies:</strong> I won't list all the movies that I like but here are some: The Dark Knight, Titanic, Superbad, 
the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, Spiderman, The Shawshank Redemption, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, The first 
three Bourne movies, The Boondock Saints, Training Day, and 8 Mile. My favorite genre is horror but I like comedies too.
